#' Join kept inclusion events.
#'
#' @description
#' This function joins the outputs from all the filtering
#' functions, by `pnr` and `dates`. Input datasets:
#'
#' - `diabetes_diagnoses`: Dates are the first and second hospital
#' diabetes diagnosis.
#'
#' - `podiatrist_services`: Dates are the first and second
#' diabetes-specific podiatrist record.
#'
#' - `gld_hba1c_after_drop_steps`: Dates are the first and second elevated HbA1c
#' test results (after excluding results potentially influenced by gestational diabetes), and the
#' first and second purchase of a glucose-lowering drug (after excluding
#' purchases potentially related to polycystic ovary syndrome or gestational diabetes).
#'
#' @param diabetes_diagnoses Output from [keep_diabetes_diagnoses()].
#' @param podiatrist_services Output from [keep_podiatrist_services()].
#' @param gld_hba1c_after_drop_steps Output from [drop_pregnancies()] and
#'    [drop_pcos()].
#'
#' @returns The same type as the input data, default as a [tibble::tibble()],
#'   with the joined columns from the output of [keep_diabetes_diagnoses()],
#'   [keep_podiatrist_services()], [drop_pcos()], and
#'   [drop_pregnancies()]. There will be 1-8 rows per `pnr`.
