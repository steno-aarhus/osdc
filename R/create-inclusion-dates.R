#' Create inclusion dates from all the inclusion events
#'
#' This function takes the output from
#' [join_inclusions()] and defines the final inclusion dates, raw and stable
#' based on all inclusion event types. Since inclusion requires at least two
#' events (can be multiple events of the same type or any combination of
#' different types), this function keeps only those with 2 or more events. E.g.,
#' an individual with two elevated HbA1c tests followed by a glucose-lowering
#' drug purchase is included at the latest elevated HbA1c test. Had the second
#' HbA1c test not been performed (or had it returned a result below the
#' diagnostic threshold), this person would instead have been included at the
#' date of the first purchase of glucose-lowering drugs.
#'
#' @param inclusions Output from [join_inclusions()].
#' @param stable_inclusion_start_date Cutoff date after which inclusion events
#'    are considered reliable (e.g., after changes in drug labeling or data
#'    entry practices). Defaults to "1998-01-01" which is one year after
#'    obstetric codes are reliable in the GLD data (since we use LPR data to
#'    drop rows related to gestational diabetes). This limits the included
#'    cohort to individuals with inclusion dates after this cutoff date.
#'
#' @returns The same type as the input data, default as a [tibble::tibble()],
#'   with the `pnr` and `date` columns along with the columns from the input
#'   that's needed to classify T1D.
#'   It also creates two new columns:
#'
#'   - `raw_inclusion_date`: Date of raw inclusion, the second earliest recorded
#'        event for each individual.
#'   - `stable_inclusion_date`: Same as raw inclusion date, but set to `NA` if
#'        the raw inclusion date is before the stable inclusion start date.
