# osdc: Open Source Diabetes Classifier for Danish Registers

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of osdc is to provide an algorithm for classifying diabetes
within the Danish registers. While there are a few algorithms used
throughout Denmark for Danish register research, they are all textual
descriptions of how to do it, rather than code-based descriptions. We
aim to make it easier and more explicit how to classify diabetes within
a Danish register context. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are able to
be classified with this algorithm.

## Installation

You can install the development version of osdc from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
