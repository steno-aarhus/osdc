# osdc

## Overview

The goal of osdc (Open Source Diabetes Classifier) is to expose an
algorithm for classifying diabetes within the Danish registers that can
be accessible as an R package. The algorithm that has been developed at
Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus is flexible and convenient to use, and
validated in terms of accuracy. While there are a few algorithms used
throughout Denmark for Danish register research, they are usually
textual descriptions of how to do it, rather than code-based
descriptions (e.g. the [Register of Selected Chronic
Diseases](https://www.esundhed.dk/-/media/Files/Publikationer/Emner/Operationer-og-diagnoser/Udvalgte-kroniske-sygdomme-svaere-psykiske-lidelser/Algoritmer-for-Udvalgte-Kroniske-Sygdomme-og-svre-psykiske-lidelser-RUKS-2022.ashx)).

In this project, we aim to make it easier and more explicit to classify
type 1 and type 2 diabetes within a Danish register context. The
original implementation of the algorithm is validated in a peer-reviewed
publication [here](https://doi.org/10.2147/clep.s407019), but we expect
to make tweaks to the algorithm over time. Any changes will be
transparent in the *osdc* repository.

## Installation

You can install the development version of osdc from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("steno-aarhus/osdc")
```

To install all dependencies **for development only**, like simulating
more data or running the full test suite, use:

``` r
pak::pak("steno-aarhus/osdc", dependencies = "all")
```

## Development

While developing the package, we use [`justfile`](https://just.systems/)
to simplify our development workflow and make it explicit. The
`justfile` contains commands that runs formatters, various checks like
CRAN checks or spelling checks, tests, and builds the files for the
website (but doesn’t publish it). We use it to ensure that we have a
consistent development workflow and that we do not forget to run any of
the important checks before committing our changes. For example, before
we make any pull request to contribute changes, we run the following
command *in the Terminal* of the project directory:

``` bash
just run-all
```
