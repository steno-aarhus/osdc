## Contents

This document will contain a relatively specific description of the
implemented algorithm. Refer to the other vignettes for background
information and a more general description of the algorithm.

## Data components

The algorithm uses five different types of data, contained in five
register sources:

1.  Hospital diagnoses
    -   The National Patient Register [Landspatientregisteret]
2.  Prescription drugs purchased
    -   The Register of Pharmaceutical Sales
        [LÃ¦gemiddelstatistikregisteret]
3.  Hemoglobin-A1c tests
    -   The Register of Laboratory Results for Research
        [Laboratoriedatabasens Forskertabel]
4.  Diabetes-specific podiatrist services
    -   The National Health Insurance Service Register
        [Sygesikringsregisteret]
5.  Sex & date of birth
    -   The Danish Civil Registration System [CPR-registeret]

## Pre-processing steps

This section describes the necessary steps required to format raw data
into a format that can be fed as input to the algorithm. The description
assumes that raw data is stored/structured in the most common format for
raw data provided on Statistics Denmark's servers.

Using the most common scenario when working with the above data on
Statistics Denmark's servers, this paragraph lists the common register
abbreviations/raw file names, their structure (year-on-year files vs. a
big blob, plus changes/breaks over time), raw variable names and
relevant values.

Depending on the contents and format of your specific raw data, you may
need to adapt the pre-processing pipeline accordingly.

## Expected input

This section describes the required structure of the data objects that
can be used as input parameters to the OSDC algorithm (preferably
presented as table examples, maybe based on the synthetic data objects)

## Algorithm logic

This section describes what operations are performed on the input data.
