## Changes since original validation

1.  Purchases of semaglutid, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are no
    longer used, neither for inclusion events nor classification of
    diabetes type (due to increasing use in treatment of non-diabetes).
2.  Diabetes type reclassification based on insulin purchases in the
    previous year is no longer used.

## Future potential changes

1.  Add support for using medical birth register to define pregnancies
    to censor GDM. Allows censoring GLD purchases all the way back to
    1995 (rather than 1997 onward, as the obstetric codes are limited
    to), and extends the window of valid dates of diagnosis to 1996
    onward.
2.  Simplify logic defining pregnancy index dates to remove dependency
    on maternal care visits (if performance in validation allows)
3.  Limit the historic scope of primary diagnoses used to evaluate
    majority of diabetes-specific diagnoses in type classification (e.g.
    only evaluation majority among the last five type-specific diabetes
    diagnoses)
