In this vignette, you'll find a description of the changes that have
been made to the OSDC algorithm since its [original
validation](https://doi.org/10.2147/CLEP.S407019). The osdc package uses
the latest changes to the algorithm. Potential changes to the algorithm,
rather than the specific implementation and code details, that we might
in the future will also be described in this vignette. We will also
provide validation metrics here whenever we make a change, and track
these validations over the different versions.

## Specific changes

### Since the original published validation (version 1)

1.  We don't use purchases of semaglutid, dapagliflozin or
    empagliflozin, neither for inclusion events nor classification of
    diabetes type (due to increasing use in treatment of non-diabetes).
2.  We no longer use diabetes type reclassification based on insulin
    purchases in the previous year.

## Validity

Algorithm validity across versions. Reports `PPV` (*positive predictive
value*) and `sensitivity` for typical cases and cases with atypical age
at onset of T1D (after age 40) and T2D (before age 40), respectively.

| Version | Diabetes type | PPV   | Sensitivity |
|---------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| 1       | T1D           | 0.943 | 0.773       |
| 1       | T1D \>40 yrs  | 0.708 | 0.378       |
| 1       | T2D           | 0.875 | 0.944       |
| 1       | T2D \<40 yrs  | 0.471 | 0.863       |

## Potential future changes

1.  Add support for using medical birth register to define pregnancies
    to censor gestational diabetes (GDM). This will allow for the
    censoring of glucose-lowering drug (GLD) purchases all the way back
    to 1995 (rather than 1997 onward, as the obstetric codes are limited
    to), and enable the extension of the window of valid dates of
    diagnosis to 1996 onward.
2.  Simplify logic defining pregnancy index dates to remove dependency
    on maternal care visits (if performance in validation allows).
3.  Limit the historic scope of primary diagnoses used to evaluate
    majority of diabetes-specific diagnoses in type classification (e.g.
    only evaluate majority among the last five type-specific diabetes
    diagnoses).
