In this vignette, you'll find a description of the changes that have
been made to the OSDC algorithm since its [original
validation](https://doi.org/10.2147/CLEP.S407019). The algorithm has
been implemented with these changes in the `osdc` package. In addition,
potential changes that might be implemented in the `osdc` package in the
future are described. When an update to the algorithm has been
implemented, this vignette will also provide validation metrics for that
version of the algorithm and track its validity across versions.

## Changes since original validation

1.  Purchases of semaglutid, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are no
    longer used, neither for inclusion events nor classification of
    diabetes type (due to increasing use in treatment of non-diabetes).
2.  Diabetes type reclassification based on insulin purchases in the
    previous year is no longer used.

## Validity

Algorithm validity across versions. Reports `PPV`: *positive predictive
value* and `Sens`: *sensitivity* overall and among cases with atypical
age at onset of T1D (after age 40) and T2D (before age 40),
respectively.

-   Paper:
    -   T1D:
        -   PPV: 0.943
        -   Sens: 0.773
    -   T1D \>40:
        -   PPV: 0.708
        -   Sens: 0.378
    -   T2D:
        -   PPV: 0.875
        -   Sens: 0.944
    -   T2D\<40:
        -   PPV: 0.471
        -   Sens: 0.863

## Future potential changes

1.  Add support for using medical birth register to define pregnancies
    to censor gestational diabetes (GDM). This will allow for the
    censoring of glucose-lowering drug (GLD) purchases all the way back
    to 1995 (rather than 1997 onward, as the obstetric codes are limited
    to), and enable the extension of the window of valid dates of
    diagnosis to 1996 onward.
2.  Simplify logic defining pregnancy index dates to remove dependency
    on maternal care visits (if performance in validation allows)
3.  Limit the historic scope of primary diagnoses used to evaluate
    majority of diabetes-specific diagnoses in type classification (e.g.
    only evaluate majority among the last five type-specific diabetes
    diagnoses)
