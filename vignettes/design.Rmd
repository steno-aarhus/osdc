## Principles

These are the guiding principles for this package:

1.  Functionality is as agnostic to data format as possible (e.g. can be
    used with SQL or Arrow connections, in a data.table format, or as a
    data.frame).
2.  Functions have consistent inputs and outputs (e.g. inputs and
    outputs are the same, regardless of specific conditions).
3.  Functions have predictable outputs based on inputs (e.g. if an input
    is a data frame, the output is a data frame).
4.  Functions have consistent naming based on their action.
5.  Functions have limited additional arguments.
