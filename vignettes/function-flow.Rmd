## Introduction

This vignette describes the function conventions and function flow of
the osdc package. The function convention sections go over how we name
functions and how we structure them in terms of input and output. The
function flow describes the functions within the package, both internal
and user-facing, which data sources they rely on, and how they are
connected to each other. First, the functions for classifying diabetes
status are presented, followed by the functions for classifying the
diabetes type.

## Function conventions

The below conventions are *ideals* only, to be used as a guidelines to
help with development and understanding of the code. They are not hard
rules.

### Naming

-   First word is an action verb, later words are objects or conditions.
-   Exclusion criteria are prefixed with `exclude_`.
-   Inclusion criteria are prefixed with `include_`.
-   Helpers that get or extract a condition (e.g., "pregnancy" or "date
    of visit") are prefixed with `get_`.
-   Helpers that drop or keep a specific condition are prefixed with
    `drop_` or `keep_` (e.g., "first visit date to maternal care for
    pregnancy after 40 weeks"). These types of helpers likely are
    contained in the `get_` functions.
-   Helpers that join registers or output of other functions are
    prefixed with `join_`.

### Input and output

-   Few arguments, with one or two core required argument.
-   `include_` functions take a register as the first argument.
    -   One input register database at a time.
-   `exclude_` functions can take a register as the first argument or
    take the output from an `include_` function.
-   Second argument can be an output data from another function.

## Function flow

The OSDC algorithm - and thereby, the osdc package - contains one main
function that will classify individuals into those with either type 1 or
type 2 diabetes using the Danish registers: `classify_diabetes()`. This
function classifies those with diabetes (type 1 or 2) based on the
Danish registers described in the `vignette("design")`. All data sources
are used as input for this function. The specific inclusion and
exclusion details are also described in the `vignette("design")`.

This results in the functionality flow for classifying diabetes status
seen below. All functions take a `data.frame` type object as input and
outputs the same type of object as the input object (a `data.frame`
type). For instance, if the input is a `data.table` object, the output
will also be a `data.table`.

The function `include_hba1c()` uses `lab_forsker` as the input data to
extract all events of tests above 48 mmol/mol.

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

### Hospital diagnosis of diabetes

The function `include_diabetes_diagnoses()` uses the hospital contacts
from LPR2 and 3 to include all dates of diabetes diagnoses. Diabetes
diagnoses from both ICD 8 and ICD 10 are included.

This function contains two helper functions:

-   `keep_diabetes_icd10()`
-   `keep_diabetes_icd8()`

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done, e.g., diagnosis codes -->

<!-- TODO: Which specific ICD 8 and 10 codes are included? -->

### Diabetes-specific podiatrist services

The function `include_podiatrist_services()` uses `sysi` or `sssy` as
input to extract the dates of all diabetes-specific podiatrist services.

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

### GLD purchases

The function `include_gld_purchases()` uses `lmdb` to extract the dates
of all GLD purchases (from 1997 onwards).

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

<!-- TODO: Add this + link to resource "For details about this, see [link]." -->

## Exclusion events

### HbA1c tests and GLD purchases during pregnancy

The function `exclude_pregnancy()` uses diagnoses from LPR2 or LPR3 as
input and is used to exclude both HbA1c tests and GLD purchases during
pregnancy.

Internally, this relies on the function `get_pregnancy_dates()` that
contains the following three helper functions:

-   `calculate_pregnancy_index_date_for_mc_visits_wo_end_date()` (this
    might be removed with the inclusion of the birth register)
-   `get_pregnancy_end_dates()`: Keep maternal care visits with an end
    date and drop visits between 40 weeks before end date and 12 weeks
    after end date.
-   `get_maternal_care_visit_dates_without_end_date()`: Uses the output
    from `get_pregnancy_end_dates()` which identifies maternal care
    visits *with* end dates to derive maternal care visits *without* end
    dates. below.

<!-- TODO: What is done with the mc visits without end dates then? -->

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

### Glucose-lowering brand drugs for weight loss

The function `exclude_wld_purchases()` uses lmdb as input and excludes
the brand drugs Saxenda and Wegovy.

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

### Metformin purchases for women below age 40

The function `exclude_potential_pcos()` as input to exclude all
purchases of metformin by women below age 40 (i.e., \<= 39 years old) at
the date of purchase. It relies on `bef` as input.

This function contains two helper functions:

-   `keep_women()`
-   `drop_age_40_below()`

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

## Get diagnosis date

The function `get_diagnosis_date()` combines the outputs from the
inclusion and exclusion functions to get the final diagnosis date.
Initially, it drops the first inclusion and exclusion events from the
function outputs with the helper `drop_first_event()`, so that only
those with two or more events are kept. This is then used to assign an
initial diagnosis according to OSDC. Then, all the outputs are joined
together with `join_diagnosis_dates()`.

Finally, the dates outside of the data coverage period are dropped with
`drop_diagnosis_dates_outside_coverage()` to end with a final diagnosis
date. For details on this censoring based on periods with insufficient
data coverage, see the `vignette("algorithm-logic")`.

## Classifying the diabetes type

The next step of the OSDC algorithm classifies individuals from the
extracted diabetes population as having either T1D or T2D. As described
in the `vignette("design")`, individuals not classified as T1D cases are
classified as T2D cases.

The output is a `data.frame` that includes one row per individual in the
diabetes population: one column with their PNR, two columns with
inclusion dates (one "stable" date and one "raw" date - see the
`vignette("algorithm-logic")` for an elaboration on what that entails),
and one column with the diabetes type.

<!-- TODO: add a link to the specific section where this is described -->

package.](images/function-flow-classification.png)

### Type 1 classification

The details for the classification of type 1 diabetes is described in
`vignette("design")`. To classify whether an individual has T1D, the
OSDC algorithm includes the following criteria:

1.  `get_t1d_primary_diagnosis()`, which relies on the hospital
    diagnoses extracted from `lpr_diag` (LPR2) and `diagnoser` (LPR3) in
    the previous steps.
2.  `get_only_insulin_purchases()` which relies on the GLD purchases
    from Lægemiddelsdatabasen to get patients where all GLD purchases
    are insulin only.
3.  `get_majority_of_t1d_diagnoses()` (as compared to T2D diagnoses)
    which again relies on primary hospital diagnoses from LPR.
4.  `get_insulin_purchase_within_180_days()` which relies on both
    diagnosis from LPR and GLD purchases from Lægemiddelsdatabasen.
5.  `get_insulin_is_two_thirds_of_gld_doses` which relies on the GLD
    purchases from Lægemiddelsdatabasen.

Note the following hierarchy in first function above: First, the
function checks whether the individual has primary diagnoses from
endocrinological specialty. If that's the case for a given person, the
check of whether they have a majority of T1D primary diagnoses are based
on data from endocrinological specialty. If that's not the case, the
check will be based on primary diagnoses from medical specialties.

### Type 2 classification

As described in the `vignette("design")`, individuals not classified as
type 1 cases are classified as type 2 cases.

## Output

The output of the OSDC algorithm is a `data.frame` which includes four
columns:

1.  **PNR**: The pseudonymised social security number of individuals in
    the diabetes population (one row per individual)
2.  **stable_inclusion_date**: The *stable* inclusion date (i.e., the
    raw date mutated so only individuals included in the time-period
    where data coverage is sufficient to make incident cases reliable)\*
    <!-- TODO: Specify this time-period: e.g., later than 1997 -->
3.  **raw_inclusion_date**: The *raw* inclusion date (i.e., the date of
    the second inclusion event as described in the [Extracting the
    diabetes population](#extracting-diabetes-population) section above)
4.  **diabetes_type** The classified diabetes type

\*For more information on the "raw" versus "stable" inclusion date, see
`vignette("algorithm-logic")`.

<!-- TODO: Make sure this is the correct link - and add a link specific to the specific section where this is described -->

For an example, see below.

| PNR        | stable_inclusion_date | raw_inclusion_date | diabetes_type |
|------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0000000001 | 2020-01-01            | 2020-01-01         | T1D           |
| 0000000004 | NULL                  | 1995-04-19         | T2D           |

: Example rows of the `data.frame` output of the osdc package.

The individuals `0000000001` and `0000000004` have been classified as
having diabetes (`T1D` and `T2D`, respectively). `0000000004` is
classified as having type 1 diabetes (T1D) with an inclusion date of
`2020-01-01`. Since this date is within a time-period of sufficient data
coverage, the column `stable_inclusion_date` is populated with the same
date as `raw_inclusion_date`.

The individual in the second row, `0000000004` is classified as having
type 2 diabetes `T2D` with an inclusion date of `1995-19-04`. Since 1995
is within a time-period of insufficient data coverage,
`stable_inclusion_date` is `NULL`. However, `raw_inclusion_date` still
contains the inclusion date of this individual.

<!-- TODO: Specify the "stable" time-period: e.g., later than 1997 -->
