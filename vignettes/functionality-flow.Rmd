## Function conventions

The below conventions are *ideals* only, to be used as a guidelines to
help with development and understanding of the code. They are not hard
rules.

### Naming

-   First word is an action verb, later words are objects or conditions.
-   Exclusion criteria are prefixed with `exclude_`.
-   Inclusion criteria are prefixed with `include_`.
-   Helpers that get or extract a condition ("pregnancy" or "date of
    visit") are prefixed with `get_`.
-   Helpers that drop or keep a specific condition are prefixed with
    `drop_` or `keep_` ("first visit date to maternal care for pregnancy
    after 40 weeks"). These types of helpers likely are contained in the
    `get_` functions.

### Input and output

-   Few arguments, with one or two core required argument.
-   `include_` functions take a register as the first argument.
    -   One input register database at a time.
-   `exclude_` functions can take a register as the first argument or
    take the output from an `include_` function.
-   Second argument can be an output data from another function.

exclusion details are also described in the `vignette("design")`.

This results in the functionality flow for classifying diabetes status
seen below. All functions take a `data.frame` type object as input and
outputs the same type of object as the input object (a `data.frame`
type). For instance, if the input is a `data.table` object, the output
will also be a `data.table`.

package. The dark grey box denotes the user-facing function, while the
remaining boxes are internal functions. Green and red boxes represent
filtering functions (inclusion and exclusion events,
respectively).](images/diabetes-population-functions.png)

## Inclusion events

### HbA1c tests above 48 mmol/mol

The function `include_hba1c()` uses `lab_forsker` as the input data to
extract all events of tests above 48 mmol/mol.

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

### Hospital diagnosis of diabetes

The function `include_diabetes_diagnoses()` uses the hospital contacts
from LPR2 and 3 to include all dates of diabetes diagnoses. Diabetes
diagnoses from both ICD 8 and ICD 10 are included.

This function contains two helper functions:

-   `extract_diabetes_diagnoses_icd_10()`
-   `extract_diabetes_diagnoses_icd_8()`

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done, e.g., diagnosis codes -->

<!-- TODO: Which specific ICD 8 and 10 codes are included? -->

### Diabetes-specific podiatrist services

The function `include_podiatrist_services()` uses `sysi` or `sssy` as
input to extract the dates of all diabetes-specific podiatrist services.

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

### GLD purchases

The function `include_gld_purchases()` uses `lmdb` to extract the dates
of all GLD purchases (from 1997 onwards).

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

<!-- TODO: Add this + link to resource "For details about this, see [link]." -->

## Exclusion events

### HbA1c tests and GLD purchases during pregnancy {#exclusion-pregnancy-windows}

The function `exclude_pregnancy_events()` uses diagnoses from LPR2 or
LPR3 as input and is used to exclude both HbA1c tests and GLD purchases
during pregnancy.

Internally, this relies on the function `extract_pregnancy_dates()` that
contains the following three helper functions:

-   `calculate_pregnancy_index_date_for_mc_visits_wo_end_date()` (this
    might be removed with the inclusion of the birth register)
-   `extract_pregnancy_end_dates()`: Extracts maternal care visits with
    an end date and exclude visits between 40 weeks before end date and
    12 weeks after end date.
-   `extract_maternal_care_visit_dates_without_end_date()`: Uses the
    output from `extract_pregnancy_end_dates()` which identifies
    maternal care visits *with* end dates to derive maternal care visits
    *without* end dates. below.

<!-- TODO: What is done with the mc visits without end dates then? -->

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

### Glucose-lowering brand drugs for weight loss

The function `exclude_weight_loss_drugs()` uses REGISTER as input and
excludes BRANDS.

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

<!-- TODO: Add data source and which brands are excluded -->

### Metformin purchases for women below age 40

The function `exclude_pcos()` uses `bef` as input to exclude all
purchases of metformin by women below age 40 (i.e., \<= 39 years old) at
the date of purchase.

This function contains two helper functions:

-   `exclude_men()`
-   `exclude_age_40_below()`

<!-- TODO: Add details on how this filtering should be done -->

## Extract raw inclusion dates

Then, the inclusion events from each inclusion criteria are joined in
the function `extract_raw_inclusion_dates()`. For each individual with
inclusion events, the date of the *second* event is extracted as the
*raw* inclusion date, i.e., the date the OSDC algorithm defines as the
diagnosis date.

## Add stable inclusion dates

Finally, from the raw inclusion dates, a stable inclusion date column is
added. The column censors inclusion dates from time-periods of
insufficient data coverage. For details on this, see the
`vignette("algorithm-logic")`.
