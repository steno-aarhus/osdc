# Description of the different non-cases included in `non_cases()`

All cases, aside from what would exclude them from being classified as
described in the metadata here, would otherwise be classified as having
diabetes.

## Usage

``` r
non_cases_metadata()
```

## Value

A named list of character strings, where each name corresponds to a
non-case PNR in the dataset generated by
[`non_cases()`](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/osdc/reference/non_cases.md).

## Examples

``` r
non_cases_metadata()
#> $nc_pcos_1
#> [1] "Woman taking metformin, older than 40, and has an indication code. No other purchases of metformin."
#> 
#> $nc_pcos_2
#> [1] "Woman taking metformin, younger than 40, and doesn't have the indication code. No other purchases of metformin."
#> 
#> $nc_pcos_3
#> [1] "Woman taking metformin, younger than 40, and has an indication code. No other purchases of metformin."
