\title{Exclude metformin purchases potentially for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome.}
\usage{
exclude_potential_pcos(gld_purchases, bef)
}
\arguments{
\item{gld_purchases}{The output from \code{include_gld_purchases()}.}

\item{bef}{The \code{bef} register.}
}
\value{
The same type as the input data, default as a \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}}.
It also has the same columns as \code{include_gld_purchases()}, except for a logical
helper variable \code{no_pcos} that is used in later functions.
}
\description{
Takes the output from \code{include_gld_purchases()} and \code{bef} (information on sex and date
of birth) to do the exclusions.
This function only performs a filtering operation so outputs the same structure and
variables as the input from \code{include_gld_purchases()}, except the addition of a logical
helper variable \code{no_pcos} that is used in later functions.
After these exclusions are made, the output is used by \code{exclude_pregnancy()}.
}
\examples{
exclude_potential_pcos(
  gld_purchases = include_gld_purchases(register_data$lmdb),
  bef = register_data$bef
)

See the \code{vignette("algorithm")} for the logic used to filter these
patients.
