\title{Keep two earliest events per PNR}
\usage{
keep_two_earliest_events(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data including at least a date and pnr column.}
}
\value{
The same type as the input data, default as a \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}}.
}
\description{
Since the classification date is based on the second instance of
an inclusion criteria, we only need to keep the earliest two events per PNR
per inclusion "stream".
}
\details{
This function is applied to each "stream", \code{diabetes_diagnoses},
\code{podiatrist_services}, and \code{gld_hba1c_after_drop_steps}, in  the
\code{classify_diabetes()} function after the keep and drop steps, right before
they are joined.
